##### AGN & ICM interaction:
From Yuanzai:
* Bruggen and Heinz 2007: [Simulating the AGN-ICM Interaction](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007hvcg.conf..187B/abstract)
    * Notes: simulation of two mechanisms: metal transport and AGN jets
* Zhang et al. 2018: [Generation of internal waves by buoyant bubbles in galaxy clusters and heating of intracluster medium](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.478.4785Z/abstract)
    * Notes: buoyant bubbles of relativistic plasma can emit internal waves if bubbles are substantially flattened. Authors performed 2D simulation

    * Notes: 4 models for AGN feedback from re-orienting jets.
* Yang et al. 2019: [The Impact of Radio AGN Bubble Composition on the Dynamics and Thermal Balance of the Intracluster Medium](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...871....6Y/abstract)

    * Notes: simulation including radiative cooling, star formation, metal enrichment and feedback from SN. Simulation showed different sources of energy feedback leave different imprints in the enrichment pattern of hot ICM

    * Notes: talks about AGN and galactic atmosphere, not ICM, not sure it’s helpful

From Chenxi:
* Gupta et al. 2020: [Constraining Radio Mode Feedback in Galaxy Clusters with the Cluster Radio AGN Properties to z∼1](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494.1705G/abstract)
    * Note:

        * Radio-mode feedback & cavity power (reference [Cavagnolo et al. 2010](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...720.1066C/abstract);
            * > Quote: This cavity power represents an estimate of the minimum mechanical feedback into the ICM.
* Zhang et al. 2018: [Generation of internal waves by buoyant bubbles in galaxy clusters and heating of intracluster medium](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.478.4785Z/abstract)
    * Note:
        * > Quote: Buoyant bubbles of relativistic plasma in cluster cores plausibly play a key role in conveying the energy from a supermassive black hole to the intracluster medium (ICM) - the process known as radio-mode AGN feedback.
